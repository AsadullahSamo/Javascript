    <!-- For modules, server is mandatory (i.e. sites with protocol https OR http) -->
    <!--  For our learning, we will be using live server -->
    <!-- 
        When working with huge projects we make multiple js files
        and the flow of script should match with the order
        i.e. If we defined a function in file2, but called it in file one, and script is listed like
        <script src="file1.js"> </script>
        <script src="file2.js"> </script>
        It will be error

        To solve such problems, modules came in handy
        multiple files of js is module
     -->
                    <!-- Javascript -->
                    
    <script src="app.js" type="module"> </script>
